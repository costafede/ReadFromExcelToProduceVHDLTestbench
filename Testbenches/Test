In this directory you can find the testbenches for the project. The testbenches are used to verify the functionality of the design and ensure that it meets the requirements. The testbenches are written in SystemVerilog and use the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) framework for verification. The testbenches are organized into different directories based on the design under test (DUT). Each directory contains a testbench file, a test file, and a scoreboard file. The testbench file contains the top-level module for the testbench, the test file contains the individual tests, and the scoreboard file contains the scoreboard for checking the results of the tests.
